* The plan
I'd like to be able to quickly sync the important files that I share across computers
Should be as easy as cloning a git repo and being in business

** Files
- .emacs.d/init.el
- .bash_profile

** Value
- emacs init file makes it easy to jump right into using emacs
- .bash_profile helps get things like aliases and environment variable right

** What needs to be done
* TODO Create repository
** DONE Add .emacs.d/init.el file
** TODO Add .bash_profile file
* TODO Create script to sync
** DONE Add figure out bash necessary to create a sync file
** TODO Determine a safe way to include placeholders for passwords
